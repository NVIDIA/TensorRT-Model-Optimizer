0.35 (2025-09-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``torch<2.6`` support.
- Deprecate NeMo 1.0 model support.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix attention head ranking logic for pruning Megatron Core GPT models.

**New Features**

- ModelOpt now supports PTQ and QAT for GPT-OSS models. See ``examples/gpt_oss`` for end-to-end PTQ/QAT example.
- Add support for QAT with HuggingFace + DeepSpeed. See ``examples/gpt_oss`` for an example.

- ModelOpt provides convenient trainers such as :class:`QATTrainer`, :class:`QADTrainer`, :class:`KDTrainer`, :class:`QATSFTTrainer` which inherits from Huggingface trainers.
  ModelOpt trainers can be used as drop in replacement of the corresponding Huggingface trainer. See usage examples in ``examples/gpt_oss``, ``examples/llm_qat`` or ``examples/llm_distill``.
- (Experimental) Add quantization support for custom TensorRT op in ONNX models.
- Add support for Minifinetuning (MFT; https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15702) self-corrective distillation, which enables training on small datasets with severely mitigated catastrophic forgetting.
- Add tree decoding support for Megatron Eagle models.
- For most VLMs, we now explicitly disable quant on the vision part so we add them to the excluded_modules during HF export.
- Add support for ``mamba_num_heads``, ``mamba_head_dim``, ``hidden_size`` and ``num_layers`` pruning for Megatron Core Mamba or Hybrid Transformer Mamba models in ``mcore_minitron`` (previously ``mcore_gpt_minitron``) mode.

0.33 (2025-07-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- PyTorch dependencies for ``modelopt.torch`` features are no longer optional and ``pip install nvidia-modelopt`` is now same as ``pip install nvidia-modelopt[torch]``.

**New Features**

- Add new CNN QAT example to demonstrate how to use ModelOpt for QAT.
- Add support for ONNX models with custom TensorRT ops in Autocast.
- Add quantization aware distillation (QAD) support in ``llm_qat`` example.

- Add NeMo 2 Simplified Flow examples for quantization aware training/distillation (QAT/QAD), speculative decoding, pruning & distillation.
- Fix a Qwen3 MOE model export issue.

0.31 (2025-06-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- NeMo and Megatron-LM distributed checkpoint (``torch-dist``) stored with legacy version can no longer be loaded. The remedy is to load the legacy distributed checkpoint with 0.29 and store a ``torch`` checkpoint and resume with 0.31 to convert to a new format. The following changes only apply to storing and resuming distributed checkpoint.
    - ``quantizer_state`` of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` is now stored in ``extra_state`` of :class:`QuantModule <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.module.QuantModule>` where it used to be stored in the sharded ``modelopt_state``.
    - The dtype and shape of ``amax`` and ``pre_quant_scale`` stored in the distributed checkpoint are now restored. Some dtype and shape are previously changed to make all decoder layers to have homogeneous structure in the checkpoint.
    - Together with megatron.core-0.13, quantized model will store and resume distributed checkpoint in a heterogenous format.
- auto_quantize API now accepts a list of quantization config dicts as the list of quantization choices.
    - This API previously accepts a list of strings of quantization format names. It was therefore limited to only pre-defined quantization formats unless through some hacks.
    - With this change, now user can easily use their own custom quantization formats for auto_quantize.
    - In addition, the ``quantization_formats`` now exclude ``None`` (indicating "do not quantize") as a valid format because the auto_quantize internally always add "do not quantize" as an option anyway.
- Model export config is refactored. The quant config in ``hf_quant_config.json`` is converted and saved to ``config.json``. ``hf_quant_config.json`` will be deprecated soon.


**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``Python 3.9`` support.

**New Features**

- Upgrade LLM examples to use TensorRT-LLM 0.19.
- Add new model support in the ``llm_ptq`` example: Qwen3 MoE.
- ModelOpt now supports advanced quantization algorithms such as AWQ, SVDQuant and SmoothQuant for cpu-offloaded Huggingface models.
- Add AutoCast tool to convert ONNX models to FP16 or BF16.
- Add ``--low_memory_mode`` flag in the llm_ptq example support to initialize HF models with compressed weights and reduce peak memory of PTQ and quantized checkpoint export.
- Support ``NemotronHForCausalLM``, ``Qwen3ForCausalLM``, ``Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`` Megatron Core model import/export (from/to HuggingFace).

0.29 (2025-05-08)

- Use the shape of Pytorch parameters and buffers of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` to initialize them during restore. This makes quantized model restoring more robust.
- Support adding new custom quantization calibration algorithms. Please refer to :func:`mtq.calibrate <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.calibrate>` or :ref:`custom calibration algorithm <custom_calibration_algorithm>` for more details.
- Add EAGLE3 (``LlamaForCausalLMEagle3``) training and unified ModelOpt checkpoint export support for Megatron-LM.
- Add support for ``--override_shapes`` flag to ONNX quantization.
   - ``--calibration_shapes`` is reserved for the input shapes used for calibration process.
   - ``--override_shapes`` is used to override the input shapes of the model with static shapes.
- Add support for UNet ONNX quantization.
- Enable ``concat_elimination`` pass by default to improve the performance of quantized ONNX models.

The legacy ``modelopt_state`` in the distributed checkpoint generated by previous modelopt version can still be loaded in 0.27 and 0.29 but will need to be stored in the new format.
- Add triton-based NVFP4 quantization kernel that delivers approximately 40% performance improvement over the previous implementation.

  By default, the data parallel group is set as the default distributed group and the tensor parallel group is disabled.
