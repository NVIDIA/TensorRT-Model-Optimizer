Model Optimizer Changelog (Linux)
=================================

0.39 (2025-11-07)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New Features**

- Add flag ``op_types_to_exclude_fp16`` in ONNX quantization to exclude ops from being converted to FP16/BF16. Alternatively, for custom TensorRT ops, this can also be done by indicating ``'fp32'`` precision in ``trt_plugins_precision``.
- Add LoRA mode support for MCore in a new peft submodule: ``modelopt.torch.peft.update_model(model, LORA_CFG)``.
- Support PTQ and fakequant in vLLM for fast evaluation of arbitrary quantization formats. See ``examples/vllm_serve`` for more details.
- Add support for ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2`` and ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v1`` in ``examples/llm_ptq``. Default to a mix of ``cnn_dailymail`` and ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2`` (gated dataset accessed using ``HF_TOKEN`` environment variable) if no dataset is specified.
- Allow specifying ``calib_seq`` in ``examples/llm_ptq`` to set the maximum sequence length for calibration.

**Documentation**

- Add general guidelines for Minitron pruning and distillation. See `examples/pruning/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning#pruning-guidelines>`_ for more details.

0.37 (2025-10-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Deprecations**

- Deprecated ModelOpt's custom docker images. Please use the PyTorch, TensorRT-LLM or TensorRT docker image directly or refer to the `installation guide <https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/getting_started/2_installation.html>`_ for more details.
- Deprecated ``quantize_mode`` argument in ``examples/onnx_ptq/evaluate.py`` to support strongly typing. Use ``engine_precision`` instead.
- Deprecated TRT-LLM's TRT backend in ``examples/llm_ptq`` and ``examples/vlm_ptq``. Tasks ``build`` and ``benchmark`` support are removed and replaced with ``quant``. ``engine_dir`` is replaced with ``checkpoint_dir`` in ``examples/llm_ptq`` and ``examples/vlm_ptq``. For performance evaluation, please use ``trtllm-bench`` directly.
- ``--export_fmt`` flag in ``examples/llm_ptq`` is removed. By default we export to the unified Hugging Face checkpoint format.
- Deprecated ``examples/vlm_eval`` as it depends on the deprecated TRT-LLM's TRT backend.

**New Features**

- ``high_precision_dtype`` default to fp16 in ONNX quantization, i.e. quantized output model weights are now FP16 by default.
- Upgrade TensorRT-LLM dependency to 1.1.0rc2.

- ModelOpt provides convenient trainers such as :class:`QATTrainer`, :class:`QADTrainer`, :class:`KDTrainer`, :class:`QATSFTTrainer` which inherits from Huggingface trainers.
  ModelOpt trainers can be used as drop in replacement of the corresponding Huggingface trainer. See usage examples in ``examples/gpt_oss``, ``examples/llm_qat`` or ``examples/llm_distill``.
- (Experimental) Add quantization support for custom TensorRT op in ONNX models.

0.33 (2025-07-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

0.31 (2025-06-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- NeMo and Megatron-LM distributed checkpoint (``torch-dist``) stored with legacy version can no longer be loaded. The remedy is to load the legacy distributed checkpoint with 0.29 and store a ``torch`` checkpoint and resume with 0.31 to convert to a new format. The following changes only apply to storing and resuming distributed checkpoint.
    - ``quantizer_state`` of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` is now stored in ``extra_state`` of :class:`QuantModule <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.module.QuantModule>` where it used to be stored in the sharded ``modelopt_state``.
    - The dtype and shape of ``amax`` and ``pre_quant_scale`` stored in the distributed checkpoint are now restored. Some dtype and shape are previously changed to make all decoder layers to have homogeneous structure in the checkpoint.
    - Together with megatron.core-0.13, quantized model will store and resume distributed checkpoint in a heterogenous format.
- auto_quantize API now accepts a list of quantization config dicts as the list of quantization choices.
    - This API previously accepts a list of strings of quantization format names. It was therefore limited to only pre-defined quantization formats unless through some hacks.
    - With this change, now user can easily use their own custom quantization formats for auto_quantize.
    - In addition, the ``quantization_formats`` now exclude ``None`` (indicating "do not quantize") as a valid format because the auto_quantize internally always add "do not quantize" as an option anyway.
- Model export config is refactored. The quant config in ``hf_quant_config.json`` is converted and saved to ``config.json``. ``hf_quant_config.json`` will be deprecated soon.


**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``Python 3.9`` support.

**New Features**

- Upgrade LLM examples to use TensorRT-LLM 0.19.
- Add new model support in the ``llm_ptq`` example: Qwen3 MoE.
- ModelOpt now supports advanced quantization algorithms such as AWQ, SVDQuant and SmoothQuant for cpu-offloaded Huggingface models.
- Add AutoCast tool to convert ONNX models to FP16 or BF16.
- Add ``--low_memory_mode`` flag in the llm_ptq example support to initialize HF models with compressed weights and reduce peak memory of PTQ and quantized checkpoint export.
- Support ``NemotronHForCausalLM``, ``Qwen3ForCausalLM``, ``Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`` Megatron Core model import/export (from/to HuggingFace).

- Use the shape of Pytorch parameters and buffers of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` to initialize them during restore. This makes quantized model restoring more robust.
- Support adding new custom quantization calibration algorithms. Please refer to :func:`mtq.calibrate <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.calibrate>` or :ref:`custom calibration algorithm <custom_calibration_algorithm>` for more details.
- Add EAGLE3 (``LlamaForCausalLMEagle3``) training and unified ModelOpt checkpoint export support for Megatron-LM.
- Add support for ``--override_shapes`` flag to ONNX quantization.
   - ``--calibration_shapes`` is reserved for the input shapes used for calibration process.

The legacy ``modelopt_state`` in the distributed checkpoint generated by previous modelopt version can still be loaded in 0.27 and 0.29 but will need to be stored in the new format.
- Add triton-based NVFP4 quantization kernel that delivers approximately 40% performance improvement over the previous implementation.

  The data and tensor parallel groups needs to be registered with ``modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_data_parallel_group`` and ``modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_tensor_parallel_group`` APIs.
  By default, the data parallel group is set as the default distributed group and the tensor parallel group is disabled.
