# Example usage of the script to compute the hidden states for a conversation dataset
# This script computes hidden states using a Hugging Face model and saves them to
# the specified output directory. It does so in a data-parallel manner across 8 GPUs, by splitting
# the input file into 8 parts and running 8 processes in parallel, one on each GPU.

# Note: depending on the write-throughput of the destination disk, this is not guaranteed
# to yield a speed improvement compared to running the model-parallel version. Consider
# benchmarking on a smaller dataset before launching a large run.
