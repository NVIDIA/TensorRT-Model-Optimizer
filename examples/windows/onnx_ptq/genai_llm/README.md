## Overview

The example script showcases how to utilize the **ModelOpt-Windows** toolkit for optimizing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models through quantization. This toolkit is designed for developers looking to enhance model performance, reduce size, and accelerate inference times, while preserving the accuracy of neural networks deployed with backends like DirectML on local RTX GPUs running Windows.

Quantization is a technique that converts models from floating-point to lower-precision formats, such as integers, which are more computationally efficient. This process can significantly speed up execution on supported hardware, while also reducing memory and bandwidth requirements.

This example takes an ONNX model as input, along with the necessary quantization settings, and generates a quantized ONNX model as output. This script can be used for quantizing popular, [ONNX Runtime GenAI](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/genai) built Large Language Models (LLMs) in the ONNX format.

### Setup

1. Install ModelOpt-Windows. Refer [installation instructions](../../README.md).

1. Install required dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Prepare ORT-GenAI Compatible Base Model

You may generate the base model using the model builder that comes with onnxruntime-genai. The ORT-GenAI's [model-builder](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/tree/main/src/python/py/models) downloads the original Pytorch model from Hugging Face, and produces an ONNX GenAI compatible base model in ONNX format. See example command-line below:

```bash
python -m onnxruntime_genai.models.builder -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B -p fp16 -e dml -o E:\llama3-8b-fp16-dml-genai
```

### Quantization

To begin quantization, run the script like below:

```bash
python quantize.py --model_name=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B \
                          --onnx_path="E:\model_store\genai\llama3-8b-fp16-dml-genai\opset_21\model.onnx" \
                          --output_path="E:\model_store\genai\llama3-8b-fp16-dml-genai\opset_21\cnn_32_lite_0.1_16\model.onnx" \
                          --calib_size=32 --algo=awq_lite --dataset=cnn
```

Run the following command to view all available parameters in the script:

```bash
python quantize.py --help
```

Note:

1. For the `algo` argument, we have following options to choose form: awq_lite, awq_clip, rtn, rtn_dq.
   - The 'awq_lite' option does core AWQ scale search and INT4 quantization.
   - The 'awq_clip' option primarily does weight clipping and INT4 quantization.
   - The 'rtn' option does INT4 RTN quantization with Q->DQ nodes for weights.
   - The 'rtn_dq' option does INT4 RTN quantization with only DQ nodes for weights.
1. RTN algorithm doesn't use calibration-data.
1. If needed for the input base model, use `--no_position_ids` command-line option to disable
   generating position_ids calibration input. The GenAI built LLM models produced with DML EP has
   position_ids input but ones produced with CUDA EP, NvTensorRtRtx EP don't have position_ids input.
   Use `--help` or command-line options table above to inspect default values.

Please refer to `quantize.py` for further details on command-line parameters.

### Evaluate the Quantized Model

To evaluate the quantized model, please refer to the [accuracy benchmarking](../../accuracy_benchmark/README.md) and [onnxruntime-genai performance benchmarking](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/tree/main/benchmark/python).

### Deployment

Once an ONNX FP16 model is quantized using ModelOpt-Windows, the resulting quantized ONNX model can be deployed on the DirectML backend using [ORT-GenAI](https://onnxruntime.ai/) or [ORT](https://onnxruntime.ai/).

Refer to the following example scripts and tutorials for deployment:

1. [ORT GenAI examples](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/tree/main/examples/python)
1. [ONNX Runtime documentation](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/python/)

### Model Support Matrix

Please refer to [support matrix](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/0_support_matrix.html) for a full list of supported features and models.

### Troubleshoot

1. **Configure Directories**

   - Update the `cache_dir` variable in the `main()` function to specify the path where you want to store Hugging Face files (optional).
   - If you're low on space on the C: drive, change the TMP and TEMP environment variable to a different drive (e.g., `D:\temp`).

1. **Authentication for Restricted Models**

   If the model you wish to use is hosted on Hugging Face and requires authentication, log in using the [huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/cli#huggingface-cli-login) before running the quantization script.

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login --token <HF_TOKEN>
   ```

1. **Check Read/Write Permissions**

   Ensure that both the input and output model paths have the necessary read and write permissions to avoid any permission-related errors.

1. **Check Output Path**

   Ensure that output .onnx file doesn't exist already. For example, if the output path is `C:\dir1\dir2\quant\model_quant.onnx` then the path `C:\dir1\dir2\quant` should be valid and the directory `quant` should not already contain `model_quant.onnx` file before quantization. If the output .onnx file already exists, then that can get appended during saving of the quantized model resulting in corrupted or invalid output model.

1. **Check Input Model**

   During INT4 AWQ execution, the input onnx model (one mentioned in `--onnx_path` argument) will be run with onnxruntime (ORT) for calibration (using ORT EP mentioned in `--calibration_eps` argument). So, make sure that input onnx model is running fine with the specified ORT EP.

1. **Config availability for calibration with NvTensorRtRtx EP**

   Note that while using `NvTensorRtRtx` for INT4 AWQ quantization, profile (min/max/opt ranges) of input-shapes of the model is created internally using the details from the model's config (e.g. config.json in HuggingFace model card). This input-shapes-profile is used during onnxruntime session creation. Make sure that config.json is available in the model-directory if `model_name` is a local model path (instead of HuggingFace model-name).

1. **Error - Invalid Position-IDs input to the ONNX model**

   The ONNX models produced using ONNX GenerativeAI (GenAI) have different IO bindings for models produced using different execution-providers (EPs). For instance, model built with DML EP has position-ids input in the ONNX model but models builts using CUDA EP or NvTensorRtRtx EP don't have position-ids inputs. So, if base model requires, use `no_position_ids` command-line argument for disabling position_ids calibration input or set "add_position_ids" variable to `False` value (hard-code) in the quantize script if required.
