# Pruning

Model pruning is a technique that removes redundant or less important parameters/connections from a neural network to reduce complexity and improve efficiency while maintaining performance.

Pruning can involve removal (prune) of Linear and Conv layers, and Transformer attention heads, MLP, and depth.

This section focuses on applying Model Optimizer's state-of-the-art complementary pruning modes to enable you to search for the best subnet architecture from your provided base model:

1. [Minitron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11796): A pruning method developed by NVIDIA Research for pruning GPT, Mamba and Hybrid Transformer Mamba models in NVIDIA NeMo or Megatron-LM framework. It uses the activation magnitudes to prune the embedding hidden size, mlp ffn hidden size, transformer attention heads, GQA query groups, mamba heads and head dimension, and number of layers of the model.
1. FastNAS: A pruning method recommended for Computer Vision models. Given a pretrained model, FastNAS finds the subnet which maximizes the score function while meeting the given constraints.
1. GradNAS: A light-weight pruning method recommended for language models like Hugging Face BERT, GPT-J. It uses the gradient information to prune the model's linear layers and attention heads to meet the given constraints.

## Pre-Requisites

For Minitron pruning for Megatron-LM / NeMo models, use the NeMo container (e.g., `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.07`) which has all the dependencies installed.

For FastNAS pruning for PyTorch Computer Vision models, no additional dependencies are required.

For GradNAS pruning for Hugging Face BERT / GPT-J, no additional dependencies are requisred.

## Getting Started

As part of the pruning process, you will need to set up the training and/or validation data loaders, and optionally define a validation score function (FastNAS) or loss function (GradNAS) and specify the desired pruning constraints (See [Support Matrix](#support-matrix) for available pruning constraints).

To prune your model, you can simply call the `mtp.prune` API and save the pruned model. If the model is pruned using FastNAS or GradNAS, you need to use `mto.save` and `mto.restore` to save and restore the pruned model; while for Minitron pruning, you can use your standard saving and loading functions since it is a homogeneous pruning.

Please see an example of Minitron pruning for Megatron-Core GPT model below (for other algorithms, please refer to the examples below).

```python
import modelopt.torch.prune as mtp
from megatron.core.models.gpt import GPTModel
from megatron.core.post_training.modelopt.gpt.model_specs import get_gpt_modelopt_spec
from megatron.core.transformer.transformer_config import TransformerConfig

# Load the Megatron-Core GPTModel with ModelOpt transformer layer spec
config = TransformerConfig(...)
model = GPTModel(
    config=config,
    transformer_layer_spec=get_gpt_modelopt_spec(config, remap_te_layernorm=True),
    ...
)

# Set up the forward loop to run on 512-1024 train samples
# For Megatron-LM framework, you can use the following utility function
from megatron.training.training import evaluate_and_print_results

def forward_loop(_):
    evaluate_and_print_results(prefix, forward_step, train_iterator, model, ...)


# Specify the pruning constraints (Check Support Matrix for available pruning dimensions)
export_config = {
    "hidden_size": 3072,
    "ffn_hidden_size": 9216,
}


# Run the pruning process (if model is a list then pass model[0] to the prune API)
# Save minitron scores at scores_path so we can re-run pruning with different export configs without running the forward loop again
# NOTE: Skip scores_path on re-running if you want to change the dataset and re-calibrate
model, pruning_scores = mtp.prune(
    model,
    mode="mcore_minitron",
    constraints={"export_config": export_config},
    dummy_input=None,  # Not used
    config={"forward_loop": forward_loop, "scores_path": "modelopt_minitron_scores.pth"},
)
```

If your model parameters are already sorted, you can skip the sorting step by setting `"skip_sorting": True` in `config` instead of passing `forward_loop`.

> [!Note]
> Fine-tuning / distillation is required after pruning to recover the accuracy. Please refer to [end-to-end pruning and distillation tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo/tree/main/tutorials/llm/qwen/pruning-distillation) for more details.

## Pruning Guidelines

### Minitron

This section provides recommendations for choosing pruning strategies and distillation hyperparameters for Minitron pruning to help achieve the best latency-accuracy trade-offs.

#### Depth Pruning

Depth pruning reduces the number of layers (`num_layers`) in the model.

**Advantages:**

- Simpler to configure - only 1 parameter to tune
- Faster inference than width-pruned models at a fixed number of parameters

**Recommendations:**

- Up to **1/3rd parameter reduction** can generally result in a model above the Pareto frontier with good latency-accuracy trade-off (when using a good quality dataset for distillation with ~80-100B tokens)
- For pruning **>50%**, use iterative pruning: compress by 30%, perform distillation, then compress again

**Examples:**

- [Qwen3-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B) (`num_layers=36`) → 6B (`num_layers=24`)
- [Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B) (`num_layers=32`) → 4.5B (`num_layers=16`)

#### Width Pruning

Width pruning reduces model dimensions per layer such as `hidden_size`, `ffn_hidden_size`, `num_attention_heads`, `num_query_groups`, `mamba_num_heads`, and `mamba_head_dim`.

**Advantages:**

- Better accuracy than depth-pruned models at a fixed number of parameters

**Recommendations:**

- Start with pruning `hidden_size` and `ffn_hidden_size` as the simplest configuration
- Up to **1/3rd parameter reduction** can generally result in a model above the Pareto frontier with good latency-accuracy trade-off (when using a good quality dataset for distillation with ~80-100B tokens)
- **Axis sensitivity:** MLP dimensions (`ffn_hidden_size`) can typically be pruned more aggressively than embedding dimensions (`hidden_size`) and attention/Mamba dimensions (`num_attention_heads`, `num_query_groups`, `mamba_num_heads`, `mamba_head_dim`)
- For pruning **>50%**, use iterative pruning: compress by 30%, perform distillation, then compress again

**Examples:**

- [Qwen3-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B) (`ffn_hidden_size=12288`, `hidden_size=4096`) → 6B (`ffn_hidden_size=9216`, `hidden_size=3584`)
- [Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B) (`ffn_hidden_size=14336`, `hidden_size=4096`) → 4.5B (`ffn_hidden_size=9216`, `hidden_size=3072`)
- [Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K) (`ffn_hidden_size=21504`, `hidden_size=4096`, `mamba_num_heads=128`) → [Nemotron-H-4B-Base-8K](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-H-4B-Base-8K) (`ffn_hidden_size=12288`, `hidden_size=3072`, `mamba_num_heads=112`) - See [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11409)

#### Depth and Width Pruning

For optimal results, combine depth and width pruning. This will require more tuning to find the best architecture.

**Examples:**

- [NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2) (`ffn_hidden_size=20480`, `hidden_size=5120`, `num_layers=62`) → [NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2) (`ffn_hidden_size=15680`, `hidden_size=4480`, `num_layers=56`) - See [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14444)

#### General Pruning Guidelines

- **Pruning ratio:** Anything **>50% pruning is hard to recover**. For such aggressive pruning, iterative pruning (compress → distill → compress again) is recommended.
- **Latency-accuracy trade-off:** The more pruning you do, the faster your model will be at the cost of lower accuracy. Choose based on your requirements.
- **Dataset quality:** Use a high-quality dataset for distillation. If you don't have a specific dataset, [Nemotron-Pretraining-SFT-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Pretraining-SFT-v1) is recommended.
- **Post-training:** Further post-training (e.g., instruction tuning, preference alignment) is needed after pruning and distillation on pre-training datasets to improve reasoning capabilities. A good dataset for post-training is [Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v2).

#### Distillation Hyperparameters

After pruning, distillation is required to recover model accuracy. Below are recommended starting hyperparameters for distillation:

| **Hyperparameter** | **Recommendation** |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Sequence Length** | 8192 (or 4096 if dataset has smaller sequences) |
| **Global Batch Size (GBS)** | 768 |
| **Micro Batch Size (MBS)** | As large as your GPU memory can accommodate |
| **Learning Rate (LR)** | 1e-4 → 1e-5 (linear decay) for 30-50% pruning<br>• More compression → higher LR<br>• Less compression → lower LR<br>• As model gets larger → reduce LR to avoid divergence |
| **Warmup Steps** | 100 |
| **Training Max Steps** | Num training tokens / (Seq len × GBS)<br>• Recommended: 80-100B tokens |
| **Data Composition** | • Standard models: 100% pre-training data<br>• Reasoning models: 70% reasoning data + 30% pre-training data |

> [!TIP]
> If you know the maximum learning rate used during the original training, a good rule of thumb for knowledge distillation is to use **1/5th of that maximum LR** when compressing by ~50%.

## Examples
