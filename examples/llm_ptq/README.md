# Post-training quantization (PTQ)

Quantization is an effective model optimization technique that compresses your models. Quantization with Model Optimizer can compress model size by 2x-4x, speeding up inference while preserving model quality.

Model Optimizer enables highly performant quantization formats including NVFP4, FP8, INT8, INT4 and supports advanced algorithms such as SmoothQuant, AWQ, SVDQuant, and Double Quantization with easy-to-use Python APIs.

This section focuses on Post-training quantization, a technique that reduces model precision after training to improve inference efficiency without requiring retraining.

## Pre-Requisites

For Hugging Face models, install Model Optimizer with `hf` dependencies using `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-modelopt/) and install the requirements for the example:

```bash
pip install nvidia-modelopt[hf]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to deploy the quantized model on TRT-LLM, you will also need to install the TRT-LLM dependencies as per the [TRT-LLM documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/quick-start-guide.html#installation). Alternatively you can use the ModelOpt docker image built from the [ModelOpt docker build step](../../docker/README.md) which has all the dependencies including TRT-LLM installed.

For NeMo models, use the NeMo container `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.04` or later which has all the dependencies including TRT-LLM installed.

## Getting Started

### 1. Quantize (Post Training Quantization)

With the simple API below, you can very easily use Model Optimizer to quantize your model. Model Optimizer achieves this by converting the precision of your model to the desired precision, and then using a small dataset (typically 128-512 samples) to [calibrate](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/_basic_quantization.html) the quantization scaling factors. The accuracy of PTQ is typically robust across different choices of calibration data, by default Model Optimizer uses [`cnn_dailymail`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail). Users can try other datasets by easily modifying the `calib_set`.

```python
import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

# Setup the model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("...")

# Simplified example set up a calibration data loader with the desired calib_size
calib_set = get_dataloader(num_samples=calib_size)

# Prepare the calibration set and define a forward loop
def forward_loop(model):
    for batch in calib_set:
        model(batch)

# PTQ with in-place replacement to quantized modules
model = mtq.quantize(model, mtq.INT8_SMOOTHQUANT_CFG, forward_loop)
```

### 2. Export Quantized Model

Once your model is quantized, you can now export that model to a checkpoint for easy deployment. \
We provide two APIs to export the quantized model:

- Unified Hugging Face checkpoints, which can be deployed on TensorRT-LLM (Pytorch and C++ backends), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
- (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM checkpoints, a format that works with TensorRT-LLM C++ backend only.

#### Unified Hugging Face Checkpoints

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_hf_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
    )
```

#### (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM Checkpoints

The user can specify the inference time TP and PP size and the export API will organize the weights to fit the target GPUs.

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        decoder_type,  # The type of the model, e.g gpt, gptj, or llama.
        dtype,  # The exported weights data type.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
        inference_tensor_parallel,  # The number of GPUs used in the inference time tensor parallel.
        inference_pipeline_parallel,  # The number of GPUs used in the inference time pipeline parallel.
        use_nfs_workspace,  # If exporting in a multi-node setup, please specify a shared directory like NFS for cross-node communication.
    )
```

After the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export, you can use the `trtllm-build` build command to build the engines from the exported checkpoints. Please check the [TensorRT-LLM Build API](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/architecture/workflow.md#build-apis) documentation for reference.

Please reference our [framework scripts](#framework-scripts) and our [docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/1_quantization.html) for more details.

## AutoQuantize

[AutoQuantize (`mtq.auto_quantize`)](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/reference/generated/modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.html#modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.auto_quantize) is a PTQ algorithm which quantizes a model by searching for the best quantization format per-layer while meeting performance constraints specified by the user. `AutoQuantize` streamlines the trade-off of model accuracy and performance.

Currently `AutoQuantize` supports only `auto_quantize_bits` as the performance constraint (for both weight-only
quantization and weight & activation quantization). `auto_quantize_bits` constraint specifies the effective number of bits for the quantized model.

You may specify an `auto_quantize_bits` constraint such as 4.8 for mixed precision quantization using `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` & `FP8_DEFAULT_CFG`.
`AutoQuantize` will automatically quantize highly sensitive layers in `FP8_DEFAULT_CFG` while keeping less sensitive layers in `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` (and even skip quantization for any extremely sensitive layers) so that
the the final mixed precision quantized model has an effective quantized bits of 4.8. This model would give a better accuracy than the model quantized with vanilla `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` configuration since the more aggressive `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` quantization was not applied for the highly sensitive layers.

Here is an example usage for `AutoQuantize` algorithm (Please see [auto_quantize](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/reference/generated/modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.html#modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.auto_quantize) API for more details):

```python

    import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

    # Define the model & calibration dataloader
    model = ...
    calib_dataloader = ...

    # Define forward_step function.
    # forward_step should take the model and data as input and return the output
    def forward_step(model, data):
        output =  model(data)
        return output

    # Define loss function which takes the model output and data as input and returns the loss
    def loss_func(output, data):
        loss = ...
        return loss


    # Perform AutoQuantize
    model, search_state_dict = mtq.auto_quantize(
        model,
        constraints = {"auto_quantize_bits": 4.8},
        # supported quantization formats are listed in `modelopt.torch.quantization.config.choices`
        quantization_formats = ["NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG", "FP8_DEFAULT_CFG"]
        data_loader = calib_dataloader,
        forward_step=forward_step,
        loss_func=loss_func,
        ...
        )
```

### AutoQuantize for Hugging Face models

`AutoQuantize` can be performed for Huggingface LLM models like [Llama-3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) as shown below:

[Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

```bash
export HF_PATH=<the downloaded LLaMA checkpoint from the Hugging Face hub, or simply the model card>
# --auto_quantize_bits specifies the constraint for `AutoQuantize`
# --quant specifies the formats to be searched for `AutoQuantize`
# NOTE: auto_quantize_bits cannot be lower than the number of bits for the smallest quantization format in --quant
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --type llama --model $HF_PATH --quant w4a8_awq,fp8 --auto_quantize_bits 4.8 --tp [1|2|4|8]  --calib_batch_size 4
```

The above example perform `AutoQuantize` where the less quantization accuracy sensitive layers are quantized with `w4a8_awq` (specified by `--quant w4a8_awq`) and the more sensitive layers
are kept un-quantized such that the effective bits is 4.8 (specified by `--auto_quantize_bits 4.8`).

The example scripts above also have an additional flag `--tasks`, where the actual tasks run in the script can be customized. The allowed tasks are `build,mmlu,benchmark,lm_eval,livecodebench` specified in the script [parser](./scripts/parser.sh). The tasks combo can be specified with a comma-separated task list. Some tasks like mmlu can take a long time to run. To run lm_eval tasks, please also specify the `--lm_eval_tasks` flag with comma separated lm_eval tasks [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks).

> *If GPU out-of-memory error is reported running the scripts, please try editing the scripts and reducing the max batch size to save GPU memory.*

> *NOTE: AutoQuantize requires backpropagation of the model. Models without backpropagation support (e.g., Llama-4) will not work with AutoQuantize.*

### AutoQuantize for NeMo models

The usage is similar for NeMo models to perform `AutoQuantize`. Please refer to the [NeMo Example Script](#nemo-example-script) section for the full setup instructions.

[Script](./scripts/nemo_example.sh)

```bash
# --auto_quantize_bits specifies the constraint for `AutoQuantize`
# --quant specifies the formats to be searched for `AutoQuantize`. Multiple formats can be searched over by passing them as comma separated values
scripts/nemo_example.sh --type gpt --model $GPT_MODEL_FILE --quant fp8,int4_awq --auto_quantize_bits 6.4 --tp [1|2|4|8]
```

## Real Quant

When working with large language models, memory constraints can be a significant challenge. ModelOpt provides a workflow for initializing HF models with compressed weights across multiple GPUs to dramatically reduce memory usage. Check `--low_memory_mode` option in hf_ptq.py for more details.

```python
import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq
from modelopt.torch.quantization.plugins import init_quantized_weights
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoConfig

# Step 1: Initialize the model with compressed weights
with init_quantized_weights(mtq.NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(ckpt_path)

# Step 2: Calibrate the model
mtq.calibrate(model, algorithm="max", forward_loop=calibrate_loop)
```

## Framework Scripts

### Hugging Face Example [Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

For LLM models like [Llama-3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama):

```bash
# Install model specific pip dependencies if needed

export HF_PATH=<the downloaded LLaMA checkpoint from the Hugging Face hub, or simply the model card>
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model $HF_PATH --quant [fp8|nvfp4|int8_sq|int4_awq|w4a8_awq] --tp [1|2|4|8]
```

> *By default `trust_remote_code` is set to false. Please turn it on if model calibration and eval requires it using `--trust_remote_code`.*

> *If the Huggingface model calibration fails on a multi-GPU system due to mismatched tensor placement, please try setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to a smaller number.*

> *FP8 calibration over a large model with limited GPU memory is not recommended but possible with the [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/usage_guides/big_modeling) package. Please tune the device_map setting in [`example_utils.py`](./example_utils.py) if needed for model loading and the calibration process can be slow.*

> *Huggingface models trained with `modelopt.torch.speculative` can be used as regular Huggingface models in PTQ. Note: there is a known issue with Huggingface models loaded across multiple GPUs for inference (i.e., "Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices..."). When encountered this error in PTQ of speculative decoding models, try reducing the number of GPUs used.*

> *Calibration by default uses left padding_side for the Huggingface tokenizer as it usually leads to lower accuracy loss. The exported tokenizer files restores the default padding_side.*

> *If a GPU OOM error occurs during model quantization despite sufficient memory, setting the --use_seq_device_map flag can help. This enforces sequential device mapping, distributing the model across GPUs and utilizing up to 80% of each GPU's memory.*

> *You can now add `--low_memory_mode` to the command when setting `--export_fmt=hf` to lower the memory requirements of the PTQ process. With this mode, the script will compress model weights to low precision before calibration. This mode is only supported for FP8 and NVFP4 with max calibration.*

#### Llama 4

We support FP8 and NVFP4 quantized Llama 4 model Hugging Face checkpoint export using the following command:

```bash
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path=<llama4 model path> --export_path=<quantized hf checkpoint> --qformat=[fp8|nvfp4] --export_fmt=hf
```

The quantized checkpoint can be deployed following the TensorRT-LLM instructions. Note since we only quantize the language model in Llama 4, the exported config has `Llama4ForCausalLM`, but TensorRT-LLM expects `Llama4ForConditionalGeneration` which is from the original Llama 4. Therefore our script will copy over the original config files to the exported checkpoint folder.

#### Deepseek R1

[PTQ for DeepSeek](../deepseek/README.md) shows how to quantize the DeepSeek model with FP4 and export to TensorRT-LLM.

### NeMo Example [Script](./scripts/nemo_example.sh)

Please refer to the [NeMo PTQ documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/model-optimization/quantization/quantization.html) for more details.

### Megatron-LM Example Script

Megatron-LM framework PTQ and TensorRT-LLM deployment examples are maintained in the Megatron-LM GitHub repo. Please refer to the examples [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/examples/export).

## Evaluate Accuracy

### TensorRT-LLM Validation

A list of accuracy validation benchmarks are provided in the [llm_eval](../llm_eval/README.md) directory. Right now MMLU, and MTbench are supported in this example by specifying the `--tasks` flag running the scripts mentioned above. For MTBench, the task only runs the answer generation stage. Please follow [fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge) to get the evaluation judge score.

The `benchmark_suite.py` script is used as a fast performance benchmark. For details, please refer to the [TensorRT-LLM documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/benchmarks/)

This example also covers the [lm_evaluation_harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), MMLU and the human eval accuracy benchmarks, whose details can be found [here](../llm_eval/README.md). The supported lm_eval evaluation tasks are listed [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks)

## Exporting Checkpoints

Model Optimizer supports provide two paths to export the quantized model:

- Unified Hugging Face checkpoints, which can be deployed on TensorRT-LLM (Pytorch and C++ backends), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
- (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM checkpoints, a format that works with TensorRT-LLM C++ backend only.

The unified checkpoint<sup>1</sup> format design reflects two key characteristics: 1. The layer structures and tensor names remain aligned with the original Hugging Face checkpoint, and 2. The same checkpoint can be deployed across multiple inference frameworks without modification. A unified checkpoint can be exported using the following commands:

> *<sup>1.</sup>Unified checkpoint export currently does not support sparsity. Speculative decoding is only supported in unified checkpoint export. For legacy deployment, exported unified checkpoint then needs a TensorRT-LLM checkpoint converter (e.g., [this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/eagle/convert_checkpoint.py)) to convert and build the TensorRT engine(s) for deployment. Alternatively, call TensorRT-LLM LLM-API to deploy the unified checkpoints e.g., check examples [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/llm-api/README.md).*

### API

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_hf_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
    )
```

### Quantize and Export

```bash
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path <huggingface_model_card> --qformat fp8 --export_fmt hf --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path> --trust_remote_code
```

### Hugging Face framework [Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

Alternatively, the framework script `huggingface_example.sh` also supports quantize and export:

```bash

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        decoder_type,  # The type of the model, e.g gpt, gptj, or llama.

    )
```

### Build the TensorRT-LLM engines

After the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export, you can use the `trtllm-build` build command to build the engines from the exported checkpoints. Please check the [TensorRT-LLM Build API](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/architecture/workflow.md#build-apis) documentation for reference.

### Technical Resources

There are many quantization schemes supported in the example scripts:

1. The [FP8 format](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-arm-and-intel-publish-fp8-specification-for-standardization-as-an-interchange-format-for-ai/) is available on the Hopper and Ada GPUs with [CUDA compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) greater than or equal to 8.9.

1. The [INT8 SmoothQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438), developed by MIT HAN Lab and NVIDIA, is designed to reduce both the GPU memory footprint and inference latency of LLM inference.

1. The [INT4 AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) is an INT4 weight only quantization and calibration method. INT4 AWQ is particularly effective for low batch inference where inference latency is dominated by weight loading time rather than the computation time itself. For low batch inference, INT4 AWQ could give lower latency than FP8/INT8 and lower accuracy degradation than INT8.

1. The W4A8 AWQ is an extension of the INT4 AWQ quantization that it also uses FP8 for activation for more speed up and acceleration.

1. The [NVFP4](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-studio-ces-geforce-rtx-50-series/) is one of the new FP4 formats supported by NVIDIA Blackwell GPU and demonstrates good accuracy compared with other 4-bit alternatives. NVFP4 can be applied to both model weights as well as activations, providing the potential for both a significant increase in math throughput and reductions in memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage compared to the FP8 data format on Blackwell.
