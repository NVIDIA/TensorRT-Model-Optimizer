Unified HuggingFace Checkpoint
=================================================================

We support exporting modelopt-optimized Huggingface models and Megatron Core models to a unified checkpoint format that can be deployed in various inference frameworks such as TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang.

The workflow is as follows:

#. Load the Huggingface models or Megatron Core models, `quantize with modelopt <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq#ptq-post-training-quantization>`_ , and export to the unified checkpoint format, where the layer structures and tensor names are aligned with the original checkpoint.
#. Load the unified checkpoint in the supported inference framework for accelerated inference.


Export Quantized Model
======================

The modelopt quantized model can be exported to the unified checkpoint format stored as

#. A group of safetensors files, containing quantized model weights and scaling factors.
#. A ``hf_quant_config.json`` file containing quantization configurations.
#. Other json files that store the model structure information, tokenizer information, and metadata.


The export API (:meth:`export_hf_checkpoint <modelopt.torch.export.unified_export_hf.export_hf_checkpoint>`) can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

    with torch.inference_mode():
        export_hf_checkpoint(
            model,  # The quantized model.
            export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
        )

Deployment with Selected Inference Frameworks
==============================================

.. tab:: TensorRT-LLM

    Follow the `TensorRT-LLM installation instructions. <https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/quick-start-guide.html#installation>`_

    Currently we support fp8 and nvfp4 quantized models for TensorRT-LLM deployment, you need v0.17.0 or later version of TensorRT-LLM.

    To run modelopt quantized model from Huggingface model hub, e.g., `nvidia/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8`_, refer to the sample code below:

    .. code-block:: python

        from tensorrt_llm import LLM, SamplingParams

        def main():

            prompts = [
                "Hello, my name is",
                "The president of the United States is",
                "The capital of France is",
                "The future of AI is",
            ]
            sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

            llm = LLM(model="nvidia/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8")

            outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

            for output in outputs:
                prompt = output.prompt
                generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
                print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
