## Model Optimizer Overview

Minimizing inference costs presents a significant challenge as generative AI models continue to grow in complexity and size.
The **NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer** (referred to as **Model Optimizer**, or **ModelOpt**) is a library comprising state-of-the-art model optimization techniques including [quantization](#quantization), [distillation](#distillation), [pruning](#pruning), [speculative decoding](#speculative-decoding) and [sparsity](#sparsity) to accelerate models.
It accepts a torch or [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) model as inputs and provides Python APIs for users to easily stack different model optimization techniques to produce an optimized quantized checkpoint.
Seamlessly integrated within the NVIDIA AI software ecosystem, the quantized checkpoint generated from Model Optimizer is ready for deployment in downstream inference frameworks like [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/quantization) or [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT).
ModelOpt is integrated with [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) and [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) for training-in-the-loop optimization techniques.
For enterprise users, the 8-bit quantization with Stable Diffusion is also available on [NVIDIA NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/).

## Installation / Docker

To use Model Optimizer with full dependencies (e.g. TensorRT-LLM deployment), we recommend using the provided docker image.

After installing the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html),
please run the following commands to build the Model Optimizer docker container which has all the necessary
dependencies pre-installed for running the examples.

```bash
# Clone the ModelOpt repository
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer.git
cd TensorRT-Model-Optimizer

# Build the docker (will be tagged `docker.io/library/modelopt_examples:latest`)
# You may customize `docker/Dockerfile` to include or exclude certain dependencies you may or may not need.
./docker/build.sh

# Run the docker image
docker run --gpus all -it --shm-size 20g --rm docker.io/library/modelopt_examples:latest bash

# Check installation (inside the docker container)
python -c "import modelopt; print(modelopt.__version__)"
```

Alternatively, you can install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-modelopt/) without TRT-LLM etc.

```bash
pip install -U "nvidia-modelopt[all]"
```

To install from source for local development, you can install it as follows:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

When installing from source, please make sure to re-run the install command everytime you pull new changes in the repository so dependencies are also updated.

See the [installation guide](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/getting_started/2_installation.html) for more details on alternate pre-built docker images or installation in a local environment.

**NOTE:** Unless specified otherwise, all example READMEs assume they are using the above ModelOpt docker image for running the examples. The example-specific dependencies are required to be installed separately from their respective `requirements.txt` files if not using the ModelOpt docker image.

## Techniques

Below is a short description of the techniques supported by Model Optimizer.

### Quantization \[[examples](./examples/README.md#quantization)\] \[[docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/1_quantization.html)\]

Quantization is an effective model optimization technique for large models. Quantization with Model Optimizer can compress model size by 2x-4x, speeding up inference while preserving model quality. Model Optimizer enables highly performant quantization formats including NVFP4, FP8, INT8, INT4, etc and supports advanced algorithms such as SmoothQuant, AWQ, SVDQuant, and Double Quantization with easy-to-use Python APIs. Both Post-training quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-aware training (QAT) are supported.

#### Quantized Checkpoints

[Quantized checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/model-optimizer-66aa84f7966b3150262481a4) in Hugging Face model hub are ready for [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) deployments. More models coming soon.

### Pruning \[[examples](./examples/README.md#pruning)\] \[[docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/2_pruning.html)\]

Pruning is a technique to reduce the model size and accelerate the inference by removing unnecessary weights. Model Optimizer provides Python APIs to prune Linear and Conv layers, and Transformer attention heads, MLP, embedding hidden size and number of layers (depth).

### Distillation \[[examples](./examples/README.md#distillation)\] \[[docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/4_distillation.html)\]

Knowledge Distillation allows for increasing the accuracy and/or convergence speed of a desired model architecture
by using a more powerful model's learned features to guide a student model's objective function into imitating it.

### Speculative Decoding \[[examples](./examples/README.md#speculative-decoding)\] \[[docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/7_speculative_decoding.html)\]

Speculative Decoding enables your model to generate multiple tokens in each generate step by using a draft model to predict tokens that are then validated by the original model in a single forward pass.
This can be useful for reducing the latency of your model and speeding up inference.
Currently, Model Optimizer supports Medusa and EAGLE speculative decoding algorithms.

### Sparsity \[[examples](./examples/README.md#sparsity)\] \[[docs](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer/guides/5_sparsity.html)\]

Sparsity is a technique to further reduce the memory footprint of deep learning models and accelerate the inference. Model Optimizer provides Python APIs to apply weight sparsity to a given model. It also supports [NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity pattern](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08378) and various sparsification methods, such as [NVIDIA ASP](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/tree/master/apex/contrib/sparsity) and [SparseGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00774).
