    ``forward_loop`` is used to forward data through the model and gather statistics for calibration.

    Args:
        model: A pytorch model
        config: A dictionary or an instance of
            :class:`QuantizeConfig <modelopt.torch.quantization.config.QuantizeConfig>` specifying the
            values for keys ``"quant_cfg"`` and ``"algorithm"``.
            It is basically a dictionary specifying the values for keys ``"quant_cfg"`` and ``"algorithm"``.
            The ``"quant_cfg"`` key specifies the quantization configurations.
            The ``"algorithm"`` key specifies the ``algorithm`` argument to

            Quantization configurations is a dictionary mapping wildcards or filter functions
            to its quantizer attributes. The wildcards or filter functions  are matched
            against the quantizer module names. The quantizer modules have names ending with
            ``weight_quantizer`` and ``input_quantizer`` and they perform weight quantization and
            input quantization (or activation quantization) respectively. The quantizer modules
            are instances of
            :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.tensor_quantizer.TensorQuantizer>`.
            The quantizer attributes are defined by :class:`QuantizerAttributeConfig`. See
            :class:`QuantizerAttributeConfig` for details on the quantizer attributes and their values.

            An example ``config`` dictionary is given below:

            See :ref:`Quantization Formats <quantization-formats>` to learn more about the supported
            quantization formats. See :ref:`Quantization Configs <quantization-configs>` for more details on
            ``config`` dictionary.

        forward_loop: A callable that forwards all calibration data through the model. This is used
            to gather statistics for calibration. It should take model as the argument. It does not need
            to return anything.

            This argument is not required for weight-only quantization with the ``"max"``
            algorithm.

            Here are a few examples for correct ``forward_loop`` definitions:
            Example 1:

            .. code-block::

                    def forward_loop(model) -> None:
                        # iterate over the data loader and forward data through the model
                        for batch in data_loader:
                            model(batch)

            Example 2:

                        return evaluate(model, task, ....)

                        evaluator.model = model
                        evaluator.evaluate()

            .. note::

                Calibration does not require forwarding the entire dataset through the model.
                Please subsample the dataset or reduce the number of batches if needed.

    r"""Perform optimal per-layer quantization by searching for the best quantization formats per-layer.

    ``auto_quantize`` uses a gradient based sensitivity score to rank the per-layer quantization formats and search
    for the best quantization formats per-layer.

    Args:
        model: A pytorch model with quantizer modules.
        constraints: Constraints for the search. Currently we support only ``effective_bits``.
            ``effective_bits`` specifies the effective number of bits for the quantized model.

            Here is an example for valid ``effective_bits`` argument:

            .. code-block:: python

                # For an effective quantization bits of 4.8
                constraints = {"effective_bits": 4.8}

        quantization_formats: A list of quantization format config dictionaries or string names to search for.
            Each config dictionary should be valid as a ``config`` argument in
            :meth:`quantize <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.quantize>`.
            The supported quantization format names are as listed by :attr:`modelopt.torch.quantization.config.choices`.

            Internally we always add "do not quantize" as a choice. Therefore, it is possible that a layer is
            not quantized by any of the quantization formats.

            Custom quantization formats can also be defined and used as a quantization format. This is a  experimental
            feature and the results may not be optimal. Here is an example:

            .. code-block:: python

                INT8_CUSTOM_QUANT_CFG = {
                    "quant_cfg": {
                        "*weight_quantizer": {"num_bits": 8, "axis": 0},
                        "*input_quantizer": {"num_bits": 8, "axis": None},
                    },
                    "algorithm": "smoothquant",
                }

                mtq.auto_quantize(
                    model,
                    constraints,
                    quantization_formats=["INT4_AWQ_CFG", INT8_CUSTOM_QUANT_CFG],
                )

            Internally we always add "do not quantize" as a choice. Therefore, it is possible that a layer is
            not quantized by any of the quantization formats.

            .. note::

                The quantization formats will be applied on a per-layer match basis. The global model level name
                based quantizer attribute setting will be ignored. For example, in ``FP8_DEFAULT_CFG`` quantizer
                configuration the key ``"*lm_head*": {"enable": False}`` disables quantization for the ``lm_head``
                layer. However in ``auto_quantize``, the quantization format for the ``lm_head`` layer will be searched.
                This is because the key ``"*lm_head*"`` sets the quantizer attributes based on the global model level
                name, not per-layer basis. The keys ``"*input_quantizer"``, ``"*weight_quantizer"`` etc. in
                ``FP8_DEFAULT_CFG`` match on a per-layer basis  - hence the corresponding quantizers
                will be set as specified.

            Here is an example `quantization_formats` argument:

             .. code-block:: python

                # A valid `quantization_formats` argument
                # This will search for the best per-layer quantization from FP8, W4A8_AWQ_BETA_CFG or No quantization
                quantization_formats = [mtq.FP8_DEFAULT_CFG, mtq.W4A8_AWQ_BETA_CFG]

        data_loader: An iterator that yields data that is to be used for calibrating quantized layers and estimating
            ``auto_quantize`` scores.
        forward_step: A callable that takes the model and a batch of data from ``data_loader`` as input, forwards
            the data through the model and returns the model output.
            This is a required argument.

            Here is an example for a valid ``forward_step``:

            .. code-block:: python

                # Takes the model and a batch of data as input and returns the model output
                def forward_step(model, batch) -> torch.Tensor:
                    output = model(batch)
                    return output

        loss_func: (Optional) A callable that takes the model output and the batch of data as input and computes the
            loss. The model output is the output given by ``forward_step``. `.backward()` will be called on the loss.

            Here is an example for a valid ``loss_func``:

            .. code-block:: python

                # Takes the model output and a batch of data as input and returns the loss
                def loss_func(output, batch) -> torch.Tensor:
                    ...
                    return loss


                # loss should be a scalar tensor such that loss.backward() can be called
                loss = loss_func(output, batch)
                loss.backward()

            If this argument is not provided, ``forward_backward_step`` should be provided.

        forward_backward_step: (Optional) A callable that takes batch of data from ``data_loader``, forwards it
            through the model, computes the loss and runs backward on the loss.

            Here is an example for a valid ``forward_backward_step`` argument:

            .. code-block:: python

                # Takes the model and a batch of data as input and runs forward and backward pass
                def forward_backward_step(model, batch) -> None:
                    output = model(batch)
                    loss = my_loss_func(output, batch)
                    run_custom_backward(loss)

            If this argument is not provided, ``loss_func`` should be provided.

        disabled_layers: (Optional) One or a list of wildcard strings to disable quantization for the layers. Example:

            .. code-block:: python

                disabled_layers = "*lm_head*"
                disabled_layers = ["*lm_head*", "*mlp*"]

        num_calib_steps: Number of batches to use for calibrating the quantized model. Suggested value is 512.
        num_score_steps: Number of batches to use for estimating ``auto_quantize`` scores. Suggested value is 128.
            A higher value could increase the time taken for performing ``auto_quantize``.
        verbose: If True, prints the search progress/intermediate results.

    Returns: A tuple (model, state_dict) where ``model`` is the searched and quantized model and
        ``state_dict`` contains the history and detailed stats of the search procedure.

    .. note::

        ``auto_quantize`` groups certain layers and restricts the quantization formats for them to be same. For example,
        Q, K, V linear layers belonging to the same transformer layer will have the same quantization format.
        This is to ensure compatibility with TensorRT-LLM which fuses these three linear layers into a single linear
        layer.

        A list of regex pattern rules as defined in :attr:`rules <.algorithms.AutoQuantizeSearcher.rules>`
        are used to specify the group of layers. The first captured group
        in the regex pattern (i.e, ``pattern.match(name).group(1)``) is used to group the layers. All the layers
        that share the same first captured group will have the same quantization format..

        For example, the rule ``r"^(.*?)\.(q_proj|k_proj|v_proj)$"``
        groups the `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj` linear layers belonging to the same transformer layer.

        You may modify the rules to group the layers as per your requirement.

        .. code-block:: python

            from modelopt.torch.quantization.algorithms import AutoQuantizeSearcher

            # To additionally group the layers belonging to same `mlp` layer,
            # add the following rule
            AutoQuantizeSearcher.rules.append(r"^(.*?)\.mlp")

            # Perform `auto_quantize`
            model, state_dict = auto_quantize(model, ...)

    .. note::

        The ``auto_quantize`` API and algorithm is experimental and subject to change. ``auto_quantize`` searched models
        might not be readily deployable to TensorRT-LLM yet.
