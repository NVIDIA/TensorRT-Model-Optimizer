"""
Unified command that runs build_replacement_library followed by calc_subblock_stats.

This script combines the functionality of both commands into a single workflow:
1. First, it builds the replacement library for the puzzle
2. Then, it calculates subblock statistics

Usage:
    cd v1
    python build_library_and_stats.py --config-dir configs --config-name Llama-3_1-8B puzzle_dir=/path/to/puzzle/dir dataset_path=/path/to/dataset

The script uses the same Hydra configuration as the individual commands and supports
all the same configuration parameters for both build_replacement_library and calc_subblock_stats.
