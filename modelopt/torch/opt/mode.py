"""Interface and utilities for optimization modes/algorithms.

A mode is a specific type or algorithms for model optimization, e.g., some type of algorithm for
pruning or quantization. It can also specify a single step within an optimization algorithm instead
of the whole algorithm. For example, a mode can prepare a model for pruning or export (i.e. fix the
optimal model configuration) after pruning.

Within ``modelopt``, a ``mode`` constitutes the unit for model optimization. We can define arbitrary
modes, each mode gets recorded in the model's modelopt state dict, and we can define workflows as a
sequence of modes.

                train flag (e.g. tracing is indirectly affected by train flag since the
